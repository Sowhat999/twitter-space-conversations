N2  - The Triple Layered Business Model Canvas is a tool for exploring sustainability-oriented business model innovation. It extends the original business model canvas by adding two layers: an environmental layer based on a lifecycle perspective and a social layer based on a stakeholder perspective. When taken together, the three layers of the business model make more explicit how an organization generates multiple types of value – economic, environmental and social. Visually representing a business model through this canvas tool supports developing and communicating a more holistic and integrated view of a business model; which also supports creatively innovating towards more sustainable business models. This paper presents the triple layer business model canvas tool and describes its key features through a re-analysis of the Nestlé Nespresso business model. This new tool contributes to sustainable business model research by providing a design tool which structures sustainability issues in business model innovation. Also, it creates two new dynamics for analysis: horizontal coherence and vertical coherence.
•Triple Layered Business Model Canvas supports sustainable business model innovation.•Visualizing horizontal and vertical coherence enhances business models.•Triple Layered Canvas visualizes and validates business models.

N2  - Studies on Product–Service Systems (PSS) are emerging as a growing body of literature driven by the desire to combine economic prosperity and sustainable resource management. However, knowledge about how companies can adopt and implement PSS has remained limited. In this study, a systematic literature review is conducted related to understanding implementation of PSS business models and five sets of tactical practices. Based on an in-depth analysis of 67 articles, it was found that PSS is increasing rapidly as a research field, which is spread across a variety of disciplines and research domains. More specifically, research findings were accumulated from the field to present a framework supporting the implementation of well-established categories of PSS business models, that is, product-oriented, use-oriented, and result-oriented business models. Each business model category is linked to five operational-level tactics that ensure the model can be implemented successfully and subsequently generates value. These tactical sets include 1) contracts, 2) marketing, 3) networks, 4) product and service design, and 5) sustainability operational practices. This study concludes by proposing suggestions for future research.

N2  - Circular business models based on remanufacturing and reuse promise significant cost savings as well as radical reductions in environmental impact. Variants of such business models have been suggested for decades, and there are notable success stories such as the Xerox product–service offering based on photocopiers that are remanufactured. Still, we are not seeing widespread adoption in industry. This paper examines causes for reluctance. Drawing on a hypothesis‐testing framework of business model innovation, we show that circular business models imply significant challenges to proactive uncertainty reduction for the entrepreneur. Moreover, we show that many product–service system variants that facilitate return flow control in circular business models further aggravate the potential negative effects of failed uncertainty reduction because of increased capital commitments. Through a longitudinal action research study we also provide a counterexample to many of the challenges identified in previous studies, which could be overcome in the studied case.

N2  - The persistence of indigenous African markets in the context of a hostile or neglectful business and policy environment makes them worthy of analysis. An investigation of Afrocentric business ethics is long overdue. Attempting to understand the actions and efforts of informal traders and artisans from their own points of view, and analysing how they organise and get by, allows for viable approaches to be identified to integrate them into global urban models and cultures. Using the utu-ubuntu model to understand the activities of traders and artisans in Nairobi's markets, this book explores how, despite being consistently excluded and disadvantaged, they shape urban spaces in and around the city, and contribute to its development as a whole. With immense resilience, and without discarding their own socio-cultural or economic values, informal traders and artisans have created a territorial complex that can be described as the African metropolis. African Markets and the Utu-buntu Business Model sheds light on the ethics and values that underpin the work of traders and artisans in Nairobi, as well as their resilience and positive impact on urbanisation. This book makes an important contribution to the discourse on urban economics and planning in African cities.

N2  - Industrial manufacturers are innovating their business models by shifting from selling products to selling outcome‐based services, where the provider (manufacturer) guarantees to deliver the performance outcomes of the products and services. This form of business model innovation requires a profound yet little understood shift in how value is created, delivered, and captured. To address this research gap, our study examines two successful and four unsuccessful cases of this shift. We find that effectiveness in business model innovation hinges on the three process phases that unfold in collaboration with the customers: value proposition definition, value provision design, and value‐in‐use delivery. We also find that that success is determined by the alignment of specific value creation and value capture activities in each phase: identifying value creation opportunities—agreeing on value distribution in value proposition definition, designing the value offering—deciding on the profit formula in the value provision design, and finally refining value creation processes—regulating incentive structures in the value‐in‐use delivery. Our process model contributes to the literature and practice on business model innovation by providing a thorough understanding of how alignment of value creation and value capture processes is ensured, whilst paying special attention to their interdependence and the interactions between provider and customer.

N2  - This paper provides the first formal model of business model innovation. Our analysis focuses on sponsor-based business model innovations where a firm monetizes its product through sponsors rather than setting prices to its customer base. We analyze strategic interactions between an innovative entrant and an incumbent where the incumbent may imitate the entrant's business model innovation once it is revealed. The results suggest that an entrant needs to strategically choose whether to reveal its innovation by competing through the new business model, or conceal it by adopting a traditional business model. We also show that the value of business model innovation may be so substantial that an incumbent may prefer to compete in a duopoly rather than to remain a monopolist.

N2  - Recent evidence suggests only modest social and economic impacts of microfinance. Favorable cost-benefit ratios then depend on low costs. This paper uses proprietary data on 1,335 microfinance institutions between 2005 and 2009, jointly serving 80.1 million borrowers, to calculate the costs of microfinance and other elements of the microfinance business model. It calculates that on average, subsidies amounted to $132 per borrower, but the distribution is highly skewed. The median microfinance institution used subsidies at a rate of just $26 per borrower, and no subsidy was used by the institution at the 25th percentile. These data suggest that, for some institutions, even modest benefits could yield impressive cost-benefit ratios. At the same time, the data show that the subsidy is large for some institutions. Counter to expectations, the most heavily-subsidized group of borrowers is customers of the most commercialized institutions, with an average of $275 per borrower and a median of $93. Customers of nongovernmental organizations, which focus on the poorest customers and women, receive a far smaller subsidy: the median microfinance nongovernmental organization used subsidy at a rate of $23 per borrower, and subsidy for the nongovernmental organization at the 25th percentile was just $3per borrower.

N2  - Business model innovation is the new strategic imperative for all leaders. Blockbuster's executives saw Netflix coming. Yet they stuck with their bricks and mortar business model, losing billions in shareholder value. They were "netflixed." Business models don't last as long as they used to. Historically CEO's have managed a single business model over their entire careers. Today, all organizations must be capable of designing, prototyping, and experimenting with new business models. The Business Model Innovation Factory provides leaders with the survival skills to create a pipeline of new business models in the face of disruptive markets and competition. Avoid being netflixed. Your organization must be a business model innovator to stay competitive in today's turbulent world.

N2  - In a global market that is constantly evolving, you can't expect "magic bullets" or "best practices"--Or any stand-alone business philosophy that many books and gurus offer-to guide your company through good times and bad. Instead you need to take an active role in reviewing and retooling your strategies. You need to stop thinking "business as usual." You need Business Model Renewal-a groundbreaking book that provides a language and multiple frameworks for how to think about and implement business model reinvention. A full-range guide to synthesizing and applying the most up-to-date thinking in business today, Business Model Renewal challenges you to re-evaluate your methods, rethink your options, and reignite your organization. Constantly challenging the mindset of "tried and true" numbers-based solutions such as market share, financials, and metrics, Gorchels integrates both traditional concepts and cutting-edge ideas to avoid the usual "one size fits all" approach that can stifle a company's growth. You'll learn how to build a custom-made business model that encompasses the totality of how your company produces value-including design, infrastructure, culture, operations, and more. You'll learn how to adapt to newest emerging technologies, how to cope with the biggest market fluctuations, how to serve the latest demographic shifts, and how to plan ahead for your company's future. Envisioning business model renewal efforts drives leaders and managers to deal with the ambiguity of future thinking. Shifts in technology, market needs, and competitive arenas can never be known precisely, but must nevertheless be anticipated. Scenario planning and other group-based, collaborative efforts to study the future are therefore necessary components of business model renewal. So, too, is corporate culture, decision making, business model portfolio design, and change management. That's why the frameworks in this book touch on all of these facets. Business Model Renewal won't give you seven proven steps, five key principles, or even 10 irrefutable laws. But it will challenge you to do the hard work of broadening the perspectives of your firm, the ecosystem in which it exists, the role of your personal leadership, and the followership within your corporate cultur.

N2  - Today's profound environmental dynamics render it increasingly difficult for firms to sustain business models with returns above the industry average. Business model innovation aims to seize a new opportunity by crafting the right new business model. It offers firms a path back to high returns and profitable growth. However, risk aversion and organizational rigidities may immobilize established industry players. Martin Trapp employs an explorative multiple-case study covering large European corporations to identify management practices. These practices support business unit managers in successfully realizing business model innovation and, together, establish a deliberate, strategic-level management approach. Contents Definition of business model innovation in established firms Placing business model innovation into the arena of corporate entrepreneurship A conceptual business model innovation process model Business model innovation management practices for business unit managers Target Groups Researchers and students in the fields of strategic management, corporate entrepreneurship and innovation management Business-unit and corporate-level managers in established firms The Author Martin Trapp conducted his doctoral research on business model innovation at the Chair of Industrial Management headed by Professor Kai-Ingo Voigt at the Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nuremberg.
